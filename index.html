                    Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on
                    coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species
                    of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.

                        <b>Type of bean.</b>
                        There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from
                        Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide.
                        However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment,
                        requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit.
                        The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and
                        survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also
                        withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.

                    <li>
                        <b>Type of roast.</b>
                        Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change
                        that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then cooled and
                        ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the
                        roast, lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity and a bitter
                        roasted flavor. The popular french roast is medium-dark
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Type of grind.</b>
                        A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine
                        grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse grind
                        is used in coffee presses.

                            privileged to connect with millions of customers every day in more than 80 markets.
                            Starbucks is seen to be the main representation of the United States' second wave of coffee

                            Donuts after discussing with company executives.[11][12] He conceived the idea for the

                            donuts and coffee were the two most popular items.</p>
